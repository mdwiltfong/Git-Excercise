Now that you have learned the basics of Git workflow, try running through this a couple of times on your own:

Create a folder called learn_git_again.[x]
cd into the learn_git_again folder.[x]
Create a file called third.txt.[x]
Initialize an empty git repository.[x]
Add third.txt to the staging area.[x]
Commit with the message “adding third.txt”.[x]
Check out your commit with git log.[x]
Create another file called fourth.txt.[x]
Add fourth.txt to the staging area.[x]
Commit with the message “adding fourth.txt”[x]
Remove the third.txt file [x]
Add this change to the staging area [x]
Commit with the message “removing third.txt” [x]
Check out your commits using git log [x]
Change your global setting to core.pager=cat - you can read more about that [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration).
Write the command to list all of the global configurations for git on your machine. You can type git config --global to find out how to do this
